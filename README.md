# guest-advisor

Our application is called Guest Advisor. The purpose of our application is to give Hotel workers and personnel the ability to write and share reviews about guests. This will allow other hotels to know more about guests prior to their stay, as well as share experiences with guests. In order to post and see information about guests a user must create an account and be logged in. Search is conducted by email as it is the most unique identifier of the a guest. 

Before starting the actual programming/coding portion of the application we brainstormed and came up with the 3 models we knew were needed, Guests, Users, and Reviews. We then created our ERDS and wireframe of how we wanted the pages to look by white boarding. We also wrote out some user stories on pivotal tracker though shifted to more of a to do list daily.


To build our application we used Node.Js with Express framework along with Mongoose for database connection and passport for authentication. This project was built on a non relational database, Mongodb. Mongolab was used to setup and store our database and allow for remote connections. Passport allowed us to keep track of user sessions and logout, login functionality. We used bootstrap and html with CSS for styling. Github and Git were used to manage version control and keep track of changes to our application. In order to deploy a live site we used Heroku.
